If you're asking yourself the question, _Why use Angular and Material Design?_ I'd like to share some of the advantages of building a Single Page Application (SPA) using Angular as the client-side JavaScript framework and Angular Material as the UI-focused framework.

## Advantages of an Angular based SPA application

- User navigation experience is improved as it allows for **partial and deferred loading of page content**, which enhances overall application performance.
- It's possible to maintain **multiple active versions of the application** by versioning build outputs, simplifying the process of reverting to previous versions.
- The application is **easy to deploy on any static content server**.
- If needed, packages can be distributed in multiple chunks through **code splitting**.
- The application can be pre-rendered on the backend using **Angular Universal to make it more SEO-friendly**.
- Angular is a **mature JavaScript framework** that, thanks to its comprehensive structure, architecture, guidelines, and a large community, **improves the productivity of the frontend development team**.
- The use of **TypeScript** as the programming language for Angular applications is **perfect for the object-oriented approach in JavaScript**.
- Angular enables **code reuse** and offers the **ability to create applications for the web, mobile web, native mobile, and native desktop**.

## Advantages of using Material Design and Angular Material

- Material Design is a **design system created by Google** for the development of user digital experiences, which **comes with a comprehensive and detailed design guide for implementation**.
- **Material Design is a visual language that combines classical design principles with innovative technology and science**.
- **Angular Material is the implementation done by the Angular team based on the Material Design guidelines**, making it seamlessly integrated with Angular.
- Angular Material provides **modern and comprehensive UI components that work across web, mobile, and desktop**.
- Angular Material is **accessible and internationalizable**, ensuring support for all users.
- Angular Material has a **Component Development Kit (CDK)**, which allows us to create our own components with a set of pre-established behaviors.
- With Angular Material, **it is possible to create custom themes based on Material Design**.
